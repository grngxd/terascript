## Benchmarks
*note: only 1 sample was taken for all of these, no swaying was involved, some of these are jokes*

| Compiler | Job | Time |
|----------|-----|------|
| terascript | create boilerplate project | n/a |
| goboscript | create boilerplate project | 0.006s |
| terascript | compile basic project (a = 5, b = a + 5) | 0.367s |
| goboscript | compile basic project (a = 5, b = a + 5) | 0.019s |
| terascript | compile itself | already done |
| goboscript | compile itself | 3 years (rust is so SLOW) |

basically, dont use this compiler, its slow and bad and useless and i hate it
